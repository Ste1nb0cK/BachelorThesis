It has been designed for students who have only had basic training on quantum mechanics, and hence, the course is suited for people at all levels. The notes are a work in progress, meaning that some proofs and many figures are still missing. However, I've tried my best to write everything in such a way that a reader can follow naturally all arguments and derivations even with these missing bits. Quantum optics treats the interaction between light and matter. We may think of light as the optical part of the electromagnetic spectrum, and matter as atoms. However, modern quantum optics covers a wild variety of systems, including superconducting circuits, confined electrons, excitons in semiconductors, defects in solid state, or the center-of-mass motion of micro-, meso-, and macroscopic systems. Moreover, quantum optics is at the heart of the field of quantum information. The ideas and experiments developed in quantum optics have also allowed us to take a fresh look at many-body problems and even high-energy physics. In addition, quantum optics holds the promise of testing foundational problems in quantum mechanics as well as physics beyond the standard model in table-sized experiments. Quantum optics is therefore a topic that no future researcher in quantum physics should miss.},

	abstract = {We study quantum frequency estimation for \$N\$ qubits subjected to independent Markovian noise, via strategies based on time-continuous monitoring of the environment. Both physical intuition and an extended convexity property of the quantum Fisher information ({QFI}) suggest that these strategies are more effective than the standard ones based on the measurement of the unconditional state after the noisy evolution. Here we focus on initial {GHZ} states and on parallel or transverse noise. For parallel noise, i.e. dephasing, we show that perfectly efficient time-continuous photo-detection allows to recover the unitary (noiseless) {QFI}, and thus to obtain a Heisenberg scaling for every value of the monitoring time. For finite detection efficiency, one falls back to the noisy standard quantum limit scaling, but with a constant enhancement due to an effective reduced dephasing. Also in the transverse noise case we obtain that the Heisenberg scaling is recovered for perfectly efficient detectors, and we find that both homodyne and photo-detection based strategies are optimal. For finite detectors efficiency, our numerical simulations show that, as expected, an enhancement can be observed, but we cannot give any conclusive statement regarding the scaling. We finally describe in detail the stable and compact numerical algorithm that we have developed in order to evaluate the precision of such time-continuous estimation strategies, and that may find application in other quantum metrology schemes.},

The mean energy and the central frequency as well as the spectral bandwidth of ultrafast pulses are simultaneously determined with a multi-pixel spectrally resolved ({MPSR}) apparatus, without changing the photonics architecture. Moreover, using a quantum frequency comb that intrinsically consists of multiple squeezed states in a family of Hermite–Gaussian spectral/temporal modes, the signal-to-noise ratios of the multiple spectral parameters estimation can surpass the standard quantum limit. Combining our multi-pixel detection scheme and the multimode entangled resource could find applications in ultrafast quantum metrology and multimode quantum information processing.},

Our experiment employs photon pairs entangled in polarization and spatial degrees of freedom to estimate a small tilt angle of a mirror. Precision limits beyond shot noise are saturated through a simple binary measurement of the polarization state.

	abstract = {A laser frequency comb is a broad spectrum composed of equidistant narrow lines. Initially invented for frequency metrology, such combs enable new approaches to spectroscopy over broad spectral bandwidths, of particular relevance to molecules. The performance of existing spectrometers — such as crossed dispersers employing, for example, virtual imaging phase array étalons, or Michelson-based Fourier transform interferometers — can be dramatically enhanced with optical frequency combs. A new class of instruments, such as dual-comb spectrometers without moving parts, enables fast and accurate measurements over broad spectral ranges. The direct self-calibration of the frequency scale of the spectra within the accuracy of an atomic clock and the negligible contribution of the instrumental line-shape will enable determinations of all spectral parameters with high accuracy for stringent comparisons with theories in atomic and molecular physics. Chip-scale frequency comb spectrometers promise integrated devices for real-time sensing in analytical chemistry and biomedicine. This Review gives a summary of the developments in the emerging and rapidly advancing field of atomic and molecular broadband spectroscopy with frequency combs.},

Quantum strategies may improve the precision, for noiseless processes, by an extra factor . For noisy processes, it is not known in general if and when this improvement can be achieved. Here we propose a general framework for obtaining attainable and useful lower bounds for the ultimate limit of precision in noisy systems. We apply this bound to lossy optical interferometry and atomic spectroscopy in the presence of dephasing, showing that it captures the main features of the transition from the 1/N to the behaviour as N increases, independently of the initial state of the probes, and even with use of adaptive feedback.},

	abstract = {Quantum estimation theory is a reformulation of random statistical theory with the modern language of quantum mechanics. In fact, the density operator plays a role similar to that of probability distribution functions in classical probability theory and statistics. However, the use of the probability distribution functions in classical theories is founded on premises that seem intuitively clear enough. Whereas in quantum theory, the situation with operators is different due to its non-commutativity nature. By exploiting this difference, quantum estimation theory aims to attain ultra-measurement precision that would otherwise be impossible with classical resources. In this thesis, we reviewed all the fundamental principles of classical estimation theory. Next, we extend our analysis to quantum estimation theory. Due to the non-commutativity of quantum mechanics, we prove the different families of {QFIs} and the corresponding {QCRBs}. We compared these bounds and discussed their accessibility in the single-parameter and multiparameter estimation cases. We also introduce {HCRB} as the most informative alternative bound suitable for multiparameter estimation protocols. Since the quantum state of light is the most accessible in practice, we studied the quantum estimation theory with the formalism of these types of quantum states. We formulate, with complete generality, the quantum estimation theory for Gaussian states in terms of their first and second moments. Furthermore, we address the motivation behind using Gaussian quantum resources and their advantages in reaching the standard quantum limits under realistic noise. In this context, we propose and analyze a measurement scheme that aims to exploit quantum Gaussian entangled states to estimate the displacement parameters under a noisy Gaussian environment.},

Any method aimed to determine the value of these quantities should resort to indirect measurements and thus corresponds to a parameter estimation problem whose solution, i.e the determination of the most precise estimator, unavoidably involves an optimization procedure. We review local quantum estimation theory and present explicit formulas for the symmetric logarithmic derivative and the quantum Fisher information of relevant families of quantum states. Estimability of a parameter is defined in terms of the quantum signal-to-noise ratio and the number of measurements needed to achieve a given relative error. The connections between the optmization procedure and the geometry of quantum statistical models are discussed. Our analysis allows to quantify quantum noise in the measurements of non observable quantities and provides a tools for the characterization of signals and devices in quantum technology.},

First we review simple metrological setups, such as quantum metrology with spin squeezed states, with Greenberger–Horne–Zeilinger states, Dicke states and singlet states. We calculate the highest precision achievable in these schemes. Then, we present the fundamental notions of quantum metrology, such as shot-noise scaling, Heisenberg scaling, the quantum Fisher information and the Cramér–Rao bound. Using these, we demonstrate that entanglement is needed to surpass the shot-noise scaling in very general metrological tasks with a linear interferometer. We discuss some applications of the quantum Fisher information, such as how it can be used to obtain a criterion for a quantum state to be a macroscopic superposition. We show how it is related to the speed of a quantum evolution, and how it appears in the theory of the quantum Zeno effect. Finally, we explain how uncorrelated noise limits the highest achievable precision in very general metrological tasks.

	abstract = {We determine quantum precision limits for estimation of damping constants and temperature of lossy bosonic channels. A direct application would be the use of light for estimation of the absorption and the temperature of a transparent slab. Analytic lower bounds are obtained for the uncertainty in the estimation, through a purification procedure that replaces the master equation description by a unitary evolution involving the system and ad hoc environments. For zero temperature, Fock states are shown to lead to the minimal uncertainty in the estimation of damping, with boson-counting being the best measurement procedure. In both damping and temperature estimates, sequential prethermalization measurements, through a stream of single bosons, may lead to huge gain in precision.},

In this Review, the authors collect some of the key theoretical results in quantum parameter estimation by presenting the theory for the quantum estimation of a single parameter, multiple parameters, and optical estimation using Gaussian states. The authors give an overview of results in areas of current research interest, such as Bayesian quantum estimation, noisy quantum metrology, and distributed quantum sensing. The authors address the question of how minimum measurement errors can be achieved using entanglement as well as more general quantum states. This review is presented from a geometric perspective. This has the advantage that it unifies a wide variety of estimation procedures and strategies, thus providing a more intuitive big picture of quantum parameter estimation.},

	abstract = {Advancements in physics are often motivated/accompanied by advancements in our precision measurements abilities. The current generation of atomic and optical interferometers is limited by shot noise, a fundamental limit when estimating a phase shift with classical light or uncorrelated atoms. In the last years, it has been clarified that the creation of special quantum correlations among particles, which will be called here useful entanglement, can strongly enhance the interferometric sensitivity. Pioneer experiments have already demonstrated the basic principles. We are probably at the verge of a second quantum revolution where quantum mechanics of many-body systems is exploited to overcome the limitations of classical technologies. This review illustrates the deep connection between entanglement and sub shot noise sensitivity.},

	abstract = {Active optical media leading to interaction Hamiltonians of the form H=λ˜(a+a†)ζ represent a crucial resource for quantum optical technology. In this paper, we address the characterization of those nonlinear media using quantum probes, as opposed to semiclassical ones. In particular, we investigate how squeezed probes may improve individual and joint estimation of the nonlinear coupling λ˜ and of the nonlinearity order ζ. Upon using tools from quantum estimation, we show that: (i) the two parameters are compatible, i.e., the may be jointly estimated without additional quantum noise; (ii) the use of squeezed probes improves precision at fixed overall energy of the probe; (iii) for low energy probes, squeezed vacuum represent the most convenient choice, whereas for increasing energy an optimal squeezing fraction may be determined; (iv) using optimized quantum probes, the scaling of the corresponding precision with energy improves, both for individual and joint estimation of the two parameters, compared to semiclassical coherent probes. We conclude that quantum probes represent a resource to enhance precision in the characterization of nonlinear media, and foresee potential applications with current technology.},

There are specialized treatises on various aspects of the foundations of {QM}, but none that integrate those topics with the standard material. This book aims to remove that unfortunate dichotomy, which has divorced the practical aspects of the subject from the interpretation and broader implications of the theory.In this edition a new chapter on quantum information is added. As the topic is still in a state of rapid development, a comprehensive treatment is not feasible. The emphasis is on the fundamental principles and some key applications, including quantum cryptography, teleportation of states, and quantum computing. The impact of quantum information theory on the foundations of quantum mechanics is discussed. In addition, there are minor revisions to several chapters.The book is intended primarily as a graduate level textbook, but it will also be of interest to physicists and philosophers who study the foundations of {QM}. Parts of it can be used by senior undergraduates too.},

	abstract = {Over the course of the past decade, decoherence has become a ubiquitous scienti?c term popular in all kinds of research, from fundamental theories of quantum physics to applications in nanoengineering. Decoherence has been hailed as the solution to long-standing foundational problems dating back to the beginnings of quantum mechanics. It has been cursed as the key obstacle to next-generation technologies, such as quantum computers (another se- ingly omnipresent ?eld of research). And while decoherence has been directly observed in various experiments, its scope and meaning have often been m- understood and misrepresented. Decoherence makes a fantastic subject of research, as it touches upon many di?erent facets of physics, from phi- sophically inclined questions of interpretation all the way to down-to-earth problems in experimental settings and engineering applications. This book will introduce the reader, in an accessible and self-contained manner, to these various fascinating aspects of decoherence. It will focus in particularontherelationofdecoherencetotheso-calledquantum-to-classical transition, i. e. , the question of how decoherence may explain the emergence of the classical appearance of the macroscopic world around us from the underlying quantum substrate. Thescopeofthisbookisrelativelybroadinordertofamiliarizethereader withthemanyfacetsofdecoherence,inboththetheoreticalandexperimental domains. Throughout the book, I have sought to maintain a healthy balance betweentheconceptualideasassociatedwiththedecoherenceprogramonthe one hand and the formal and mathematical details on the other hand. This book will establish a proper understanding of decoherence as a pure quantum phenomenon and will emphasize the importance of the correct interpretation of the consequences and achievements of decoherence.},

Sethna's text distills the subject to be accessible to those in all realms of science and engineering -- avoiding extensive use of quantum mechanics, thermodynamics, and molecular physics. Statistical mechanics explains how bacteria search for food, and how {DNA} replication is proof-read in biology; optimizes data compression, and explains transitions in complexity in computer science; explains the onset of chaos, and launched random matrix theory in mathematics; addresses extreme events in engineering; and models pandemics and language usage in the social sciences. Sethna's exercises introduce physicists to these triumphs and a hundred others -- broadening the horizons of scholars both practicing and nascent. Flipped classrooms and remote learning can now rely on 33 pre-class exercises that test reading comprehension (Emergent vs. fundamental; Weirdness in high dimensions; Aging, entropy and {DNA}), and 70 in-class activities that illuminate and broaden knowledge (Card shuffling; Human correlations; Crackling noises). Science is awash in information, providing ready access to definitions, explanations, and pedagogy.
